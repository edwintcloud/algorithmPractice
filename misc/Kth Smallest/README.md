# kth Smallest in Unsorted Array
Given an array and a number n where n is smaller than size of array, we need to find the kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct. Can you do this in O(n) average time complexity?

## Examples:
```python
Input: arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]
       k = 3
Output: 7

Input: arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]
       k = 4
Output: 10
