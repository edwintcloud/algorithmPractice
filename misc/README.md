13. Given 2 unsorted variable length lists, find duplicates and return duplicates in Time: 0(n) and Space: 0(1). [solution](/misc/question13.py)
14. 3Sum - Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero. The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets. [solution](/misc/question14.py)
